How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

it gave me focus for the finding the problem's place.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

it can help going back to a better versions and learn from my mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

you have the power to decide when the change is to big for furter diff

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because changing one file can effect others and therefor it better for the future changes that it will saved together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

in order to compare we have to first check the id using git log and then making the diff using this 2 ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

because we can find the problem easly 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
